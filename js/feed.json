      "description": "&lt;p&gt;When a man routinely hailed as one of America&rsquo;s &ldquo;greatest living writers&rdquo; publishes a new novel, one hardly expects it to draw reviews posing questions along the lines of &ldquo;&lt;em&gt;Can&lt;/em&gt; he do it? Can he &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; pull it off?&rdquo; Because when you&rsquo;re Michael Chabon, Pulitzer Prize winner, the act of writing a decent novel ought to be taken as something of a given. But Chabon&rsquo;s newest book, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0061493341/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0061493341&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=slatmaga-20&quot;&gt;Telegraph Avenue&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, out last week, is set against the backdrop of race, and its author undertakes the task of inhabiting and giving life to characters whose skin color is different from his own. The book is a sprawling narrative about the intertwined lives of Archy Stallings and Nat Jaffe, two proprietors, one black and one white, and a used vinyl store trying to survive on the shifting, gentrifying frontier between hippie-dippy Berkeley and its neighbor, the historically black enclave of Oakland. Or, as Chabon neatly puts it, &ldquo;the ragged fault line where the urban plates of Berkeley and Oakland subducted.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;"

      "description": "&lt;p&gt;A word of warning: If you decide to download Rob Delaney&rsquo;s new &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.robdelaney.com/&quot;&gt;online-only standup special&lt;/a&gt;, you should be prepared to listen to a great many reflections on, and observations about, the subject of semen. Delaney does tackle a variety of other (mostly autobiographical) topics throughout the course of the 60 minute special&mdash;unsuccessful experiments in anal sex, the methodology of masturbation, torrential public diarrhea, flatulence as a weapon of class warfare&mdash;but it&rsquo;s to semen that he most frequently returns. It&rsquo;s the conspicuous leitmotif of his work. &lt;em&gt;All That Jizz&lt;/em&gt; probably wouldn&rsquo;t be a commercially viable title to give a comedy special (even a self-released download-only comedy special), but it would have been no less accurate than the brusquely utilitarian &lt;em&gt;Live at the Bowery Ballroom.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"
