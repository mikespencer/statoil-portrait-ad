    "description": "&lt;p&gt;Black-and-white colobus monkeys scrambled through the branches of Congo&rsquo;s Ituri Forest in 1957 as a small band of Mbuti hunters wound cautiously through the undergrowth, joined by anthropologist Colin Turnbull. The Mbuti are pygmies, about 4 feet tall, but they are powerful and tough. Any one of them could take down an elephant with only a short-handled spear. Recent &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.1000448&quot;&gt;genetic evidence&lt;/a&gt; suggests that pygmies have lived in this region for about 60,000 years. But this particular hunt reflected a timeless ethical conflict for our species, and one that has special relevance for contemporary American society.&lt;/p&gt;"
